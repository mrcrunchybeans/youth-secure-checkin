## 🔐 Security Verification

✅ **Encryption Setup:**
- Keys must be 64-char hex (DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY)
- Keys must be 44-char base64 (FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY)
- Keys generated with secure random
- Keys stored in .env (not in code)
- Keys backed up separately

✅ **Database Security:**
- AES-256 SQLCipher for database at rest
- Fernet for field-level encryption
- Backup created before migration
- Backup stored in data/backups/
- Can be deleted after 30 days

✅ **Backwards Compatibility:**
- Old unencrypted databases still work
- New databases encrypted from start
- Migration is non-destructive
- Original data backed up before changes
