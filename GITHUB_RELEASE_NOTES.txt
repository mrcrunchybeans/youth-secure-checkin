## 🔐 Automatic Encryption Migration (NEW)

When you update to v1.0.1, database encryption migration happens **completely automatically on startup**. No manual steps needed!

**What gets encrypted:**
- Database at rest (AES-256 SQLCipher)
- Sensitive fields: names, phone numbers, addresses, notes (Fernet)

**For users:** Just add encryption keys to `.env` and restart. That's it!

```bash
# Generate encryption keys
DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(python3 -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())")

# Add to .env
echo "DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY" >> .env
echo "FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY" >> .env

# Restart (migration runs automatically on startup)
docker compose pull
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

Migration happens silently, backups are created automatically, and the app continues normally with encrypted data.

**See [DOCKER_ENCRYPTION_MIGRATION.md](https://github.com/mrcrunchybeans/youth-secure-checkin/blob/master/DOCKER_ENCRYPTION_MIGRATION.md) for full details.**

## 🎨 Improved Family Data Entry

The Add/Edit Family page has been redesigned for clarity:

**Before:** Confusing form with unclear "Group/Troop" field that users were filling with last names

**After:** 
- Clear sections: Authorization Settings → Adults → Children
- Helpful examples in placeholders (e.g., "John Smith", "555-123-4567")
- Context about how data is used
- Better visual organization with card-based layout
- Clearer labels and button text

This makes it obvious what information to enter and how it's used during check-in.

## 🚀 How to Update

### Existing users (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1)

```bash
# 1. Generate and add encryption keys (see above)
# 2. Pull latest image
docker compose pull

# 3. Restart
docker compose down
docker compose up -d

# 4. Done! Migration happens automatically.
```

### New installations

Encryption is included from the start. See README for setup.

## ✅ What to Test

1. **Add/Edit Family** - New cleaner form with helpful examples
2. **Encryption Migration** - Pull image, add keys, restart, check logs
3. **Manual Migration** - Set `SKIP_AUTO_ENCRYPTION=1` to defer if needed
4. **Rollback** - Restore from `data/backups/checkin.db.backup-*` if needed

---

## 🛡️ Security

**Keys are unique per deployment:**
```bash
# Each instance gets its own keys
DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)      # 64-char hex string
FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(python3 -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())")  # 44-char base64
```

**Store safely:**
- ✅ In `.env` (never commit to Git)
- ✅ In password manager
- ✅ Backup separately from database
- ❌ NOT in plain text in docker-compose.yml
- ❌ NOT hardcoded anywhere

**Backups:**
- Created automatically before encryption
- Located in `data/backups/checkin.db.backup-TIMESTAMP`
- Can be deleted after 30 days of stable operation
