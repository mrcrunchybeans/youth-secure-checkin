# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is Youth Secure Check-in?
Youth Secure Check-in is a free, open-source check-in/check-out system designed for youth organizations. It helps track attendance, manage family records, and ensure children are released only to authorized adults.

### Who is this system designed for?
This system is perfect for:
- Trail Life USA troops and outposts
- Scouting organizations (BSA, Girl Scouts, etc.)
- Churches (children's ministry, youth groups)
- Schools (after-school programs, clubs)
- Community centers (sports teams, activities)
- Childcare facilities
- Any organization tracking youth attendance and pickup

### Is this really free?
Yes! This project is open-source under the MIT License. You can use it, modify it, and deploy it without any licensing fees.

### Do I need programming experience to use this?
No programming experience is required to **use** the system. The setup wizard guides you through initial configuration. However, deploying to a production server does require basic Linux system administration skills. See our [Deployment Guide](../DEPLOYMENT.md) for help.

## Installation & Setup

### What are the system requirements?
**Minimum:**
- Python 3.10 or higher
- 512 MB RAM
- 100 MB disk space
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

**Recommended:**
- Python 3.11+
- 1 GB RAM
- 500 MB disk space (for logs and backups)
- Linux server for production deployment

### How do I install it?
See the [Quick Start](../README.md#-quick-start) section in the README. Basic steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python dependencies
3. Configure environment variables
4. Initialize the database
5. Run the application

### What is the `.env` file and why do I need it?
The `.env` file stores sensitive configuration like your secret encryption key and developer password. It should never be committed to Git. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values.

### How do I generate a SECRET_KEY?
Run this Python command:
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```
Copy the output into your `.env` file.

### What should I set as the DEVELOPER_PASSWORD?
Choose a strong, unique password. This is your backup admin access and is required to modify the admin override code. Store it securely (password manager recommended).

### Do I need a domain name?
Not required for local use. For production deployment with external access, a domain name is recommended for SSL/TLS certificates.

## Features & Usage

### How do families check in?
1. Enter last 4 digits of their phone number
2. Select their family from the list
3. Choose the event from the dropdown
4. Tap each child to check them in
5. QR code or label is generated for checkout

### Can multiple families have the same phone number?
The system uses the last 4 digits of phone numbers. If multiple families have the same last 4 digits, they'll both appear in the list. Users select the correct family by name.

### How do checkout codes work?
**QR Codes:**
- Display on screen after check-in
- Scan with any QR code reader
- Opens checkout page automatically

**Printed Labels:**
- Requires Brother QL series printer
- Prints at check-in with family name and code
- Enter code at kiosk to checkout

### Can I use both QR codes and labels?
Yes! In Security Settings, choose "Both Methods" to support families with and without smartphones.

### How do I import families from a CSV?
1. Go to Admin Panel → Families → Import Families
2. Download the CSV template
3. Fill in your family data (see column descriptions)
4. Upload the completed CSV
5. Review the import summary

### What CSV formats are supported?
The import is very flexible and supports multiple column name variations:
- **Phone**: "Mobile Phone", "Phone", "Cell", "Telephone"
- **Group**: Uses your configured term (Troop, Den, Class, Group)
- **Youth**: "Youth", "Y", "Child", "Kid"
- **Authorized Adults**: "Authorized Adults", "Authorized", "Pickup Adults"
- **Notes**: "Notes", "Note", "Comments", "Special Notes"

### How do I backup my data?
**Configuration:**
1. Admin Panel → Backup & Restore → Export
2. Downloads JSON file with all settings

**Family Data:**
1. Admin Panel → Families → Export to CSV
2. Downloads CSV with all family records

### How do I restore from backup?
**Configuration:**
1. Admin Panel → Backup & Restore → Restore
2. Upload your JSON backup file
3. Confirm the restore

**Family Data:**
1. Admin Panel → Families → Import Families
2. Upload your CSV backup

## Security & Access

### What are the different password levels?
1. **App Password**: Main login for check-in/admin access (set in setup wizard)
2. **Admin Override Password**: Allows overriding checkout requirements (set in Security Settings)
3. **Developer Password**: Backup access and unlocks override settings (set in `.env` file)

### What changed in v1.0.3 for security?
**Major security enhancements:**
- **Password Hashing**: All passwords now stored as PBKDF2-SHA256 hashes (not plaintext)
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 5 login attempts per minute per IP address
- **Account Lockout**: 15-minute automatic lockout after 5 failed attempts
- **Strong Password Requirements**: 12+ chars with uppercase, lowercase, number, special char
- **HTTP Security Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, and more
- **Automatic Migration**: Old plaintext passwords automatically hashed on upgrade

### Why was my password rejected?
Starting in v1.0.3, app passwords require:
- **At least 12 characters** (increased from 4)
- **At least one uppercase letter** (A-Z)
- **At least one lowercase letter** (a-z)
- **At least one number** (0-9)
- **At least one special character** (!@#$%^&*)

Example: `MyOrg2025!Secure`

### My account is locked, what happened?
You tried to login with the wrong password 5+ times. The system automatically locked your IP address for **15 minutes** to prevent brute force attacks. After 15 minutes, try again with the correct password.

If you forgot the password, you can:
1. Wait 15 minutes and use the Admin Override password
2. Or use the developer password (from `.env` file) to reset it

### I forgot my app password, what do I do?
1. **If not locked out**: Use Admin Override password (go to Admin Panel → Security → "Unlock Override Settings")
2. **If locked out**: Wait 15 minutes for lockout to expire
3. Use developer password from `.env` file to log in
4. Go to Security Settings to reset the app password

### I forgot my developer password, what do I do?
The developer password is in your `.env` file on the server. If you lost the file:
1. Generate a new developer password
2. Update `.env` with the new password
3. Restart the application

### How secure is this system?
- **Passwords** are stored with PBKDF2-SHA256 hashing (not plaintext)
- **Session data** is encrypted with Fernet (cryptography library)
- **Rate limiting** prevents brute force attacks
- **Database** can be encrypted at rest with SQLCipher
- **Developer password** stored outside database (`.env` only)
- **HTTP headers** enforce HTTPS and prevent common attacks
- **Regular security updates** via GitHub

See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for detailed security information.

### Can I use this on a public server?
Yes, and it's recommended! v1.0.3 includes enterprise-grade protections. To be safe:
- **Use HTTPS/SSL** (Let's Encrypt recommended) - enforced by HTTP headers
- **Set strong passwords** (system enforces minimum requirements)
- **Keep the software updated** (pull latest from GitHub)
- **Restrict access** with firewall rules for admin URLs
- **Enable database encryption** for sensitive data
- Follow the [Security Guide](../SECURITY.md)

## Technical Questions

### What database does this use?
SQLite - a lightweight, embedded database. No separate database server needed. The database file is `checkin.db`.

### Can I use PostgreSQL or MySQL?
Currently SQLite only. Database abstraction for other engines is a potential future feature.

### How do I upgrade to a new version?
```bash
cd youth-secure-checkin
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
# Restart the application
```

### Can I run this in a Docker container?
Docker support is planned for a future release. Current deployment options:
- Linux server with systemd (recommended)
- Heroku/Railway/Render (PaaS)
- Windows/Mac for development only

### What Python version do I need?
Python 3.10 or higher. Python 3.11+ recommended for best performance.

### Does this work on Windows?
Yes for development. For production, Linux is strongly recommended.

## Troubleshooting

### The app won't start - "Module not found" error
Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### I get "Database is locked" errors
SQLite has limited concurrent write support. This usually means:
- Multiple processes accessing the database
- Restart the application
- Check that only one instance is running

### Labels won't print
1. Check printer is connected and powered on
2. Verify printer model in Security Settings
3. Install Brother QL drivers
4. Test with Brother's software first
5. Check USB permissions (Linux)

### QR codes aren't working
1. Verify the QR code scans to a valid URL
2. Check the code hasn't expired (if using time-based codes)
3. Ensure good lighting for camera scanning
4. Try a different QR scanner app

### Events aren't importing from iCal
1. Verify the iCal URL is accessible
2. Check the URL returns valid iCalendar format
3. Ensure events have start times
4. Check date range settings in Branding

### I can't access the admin panel
1. Log in with app password
2. If forgotten, use developer password
3. If developer password forgotten, check `.env` file

### The system is running slow
1. Check server resources (CPU, RAM, disk)
2. Review database size (`ls -lh checkin.db`)
3. Clear old check-in history if needed
4. Increase worker processes (production)

### Check-ins aren't saving
1. Check disk space
2. Verify database file permissions
3. Check application logs for errors
4. Ensure database isn't corrupted
